# Hey Git and GitHub.
This is my first repo EVER ! I'm pumped. Let's see what will come next.

After playing more with the second repo created "git-training", i decided to fully switched my practice to it.

This repo will stay here, like all others (probably) in order to keep traces of my path. In combination with my [blog](https://www.jeremyperreau.com) this marriage will be a good way, for anyone interested surely!, to track more precisely what and how i have done what i now have.

Reach out for anything !
